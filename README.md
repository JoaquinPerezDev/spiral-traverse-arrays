# spiral-traverse-arrays

ALGO EXPERT MEDIUM 

Write a function that takes in an n x m 2D array(that can be square-shaped when n == m) and returns a one-dimensional array of all the array's elements in spiral order.

Spiral order starts at the top left corner of the 2D array, goes to the right and proceeds in a spiral pattern all the way until every element has been visited.

Sample input: array = <br>
[ <br>
  [1,   2,  3, 4], <br>
  [12, 13, 14, 5], <br>
  [11, 16, 15, 6], <br> 
  [10, 9,   8, 7], <br>
] <br>

Sample output: 
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
